# maestro-automation
This project demonstrates the use of Maestro to automate a mobile app.


## üöÄ Getting Started

### üöß Prerequisites

> Disclaimer: The content, code, and testing of this project have been developed and evaluated primarily using Windows and Android testing perspectives. For other configurations, please refer to [maestro.mobile.dev](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) website for guidelines.

Before you can run this project, you must have the following software installed on your computer:

- WSL2 (Window Subsystem for Linux)
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 11 or later
- SDK and emulator setup _(on this case, I used Android Studio)_
- Mobile application under test

#### üö® Mobile application under test
* [Toyota Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.toyota.EntuneToyota&hl=en) 
* [Lexus Enform](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.intelematics.EntuneLexus&hl=en_AU) <br/>
  Note that the app files are not uploaded into this repository intentionally.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. Run the following command to install Maestro.
   ```sh
   curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash
   ```
   Or, you may follow the environment setup directly from the [maestro.mobile.dev](https://maestro.mobile.dev/) website depending on your system [here](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro). 
2. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
   ```sh
   https://github.com/marizala/maestro-automation.git
   ```

### üë®üèº‚Äçüî¨Tests
This project contains 2 sample test cases that demonstrate how to use Maestro to interact with mobile app in Android platform.


#### üß™ Test Cases
* `get-started.yaml`: Application onboarding process (accept Terms and Conditions, allow permission requests) and basic map actions.
* `trip-CRUD.yaml`: Basic create, read, update and delete of a trip record.


### üèÉüèΩ How to run the tests locally
1. Run your emulator. 
   ```
   emulator -avd <device_name>
   ```

2. In Powershell, start the adb server.
   ```
   adb -a -P 5037 nodaemon server
   ```

3. Open WSL2 terminal in the project root directory and run these commands.
   ```
   adb kill-server
   export ADB_SERVER_SOCKET=tcp:<WINDOWS_IPV4_ADDRESS>:5037
   adb devices
   ```
4. Run your flow (test case) with this command.
   ```
   maestro --host <WINDOWS_IPV4_ADDRESS> --device <device_name> test -e APP_ID=<APP_ID> toyota-link/tests/trip-CRUD.yaml
   ```


#### ‚öôÔ∏è Useful commands (Android)

* To install the mobile application `adb -s <device_name> install <apk file>`
* To clear app data `adb shell pm clear <app_id>`
